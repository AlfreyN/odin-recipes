    <h2>A Congolese dish made with cassava leaves</h2>
    <h3>
    <br>
    Description:
    <p></p>
    This dish is often served either with rice or with what is called a 'swallow' from my own experience,
    a swallow is a food item which can be 'dipped' into the pondu and can be eaten with little to no chewing
    due to its texture adn is eaten with your hands.
